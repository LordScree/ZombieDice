# zombie-dice
A .NET8 C# implementation of the dice game Zombie Dice

# Why?
I played this game last night with some mates. Enjoyed it. Was inspired to have
a crack at a .NET8 implementation.

# Todo
1. Players are currently hard-coded. Add flexibility here.
2. Remember scores over multiple games?
3. Console colours?
