# LordScree's Zombie Dice
A .NET8 C# implementation of the dice game Zombie Dice by Steve Jackson.
I don't own any rights to Zombie Dice or the mechanics of this game.
See the following Wikipedia article for original rules: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_Dice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_Dice)
This console variant probably differs slightly from the original.

# Why?
I played this game last night with some mates. Enjoyed it. Was inspired to have
a crack at a .NET8 implementation.

# Todo
1. Add some tests (any tests...? TEST IT!).
1. Players are currently hard-coded. Add flexibility here.
1. Remember scores over multiple games?
1. Console colours?
